# Diana's Kitchenette (fronend)

Hello and welcome to my personal kitchenette! This is a recipe book app that contains all of my recipes, with all of the instructions and relevant informaiton, and serves them with a neat looking UI. 

This project originally started off as a webjam, but I quickly grew fond of it and decided to take it the entire way.
